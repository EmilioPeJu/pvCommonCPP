Boost.Random has a binary component which is only needed if you're using random_device.
Boost.Test can be used in “header-only” or “separately compiled” mode, although separate compilation is recommended for serious use.
Boost.Atomic has one cpp in case of no-lockfree support.

Boost.Build was added in case somebody would like to build anything...
